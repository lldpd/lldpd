	 * padding odd sized data with a zero byte _at the end_ it sets the last
	 * big endian _word_ to contain the last network _octet_. This byteswap
	 * has to be done on the last octet of network data before feeding it to
	 * the Internet checksum routine.
	 * CDP checksumming code has a bug in the addition of this last _word_
	 * as a signed number into the long word intermediate checksum. When
	 * reducing this long to word size checksum an off-by-one error can be
	 * made. This off-by-one error is compensated for in the last _word_ of
	 * the network data.
