/**
 * Match a list of patterns.
 *
 * @param string   String to match against the list of patterns
 * @param patterns List of comma separated patterns. A pattern may
 *                 begin by `!` to negate it. In this case, it is
 *                 denied. A pattern may begin with `!!`. In this
 *                 case, it is allowed back. Each pattern will then be
 *                 matched against `fnmatch()` function.
 * @param found    Value to return if the pattern isn't found. Should be either
 *                 PATTERN_MATCH_ALLOWED or PATTERN_MACTH_DENIED.
 *
 * If a pattern is found matching and denied at the same time, it
 * will be denied. If it is both allowed and denied, it
 * will be allowed.
 *
 * @return PATTERN_MATCH_DENIED if the string matches a denied pattern which is not
 *         allowed or if the pattern wasn't found and `found` was set to
 *         PATTERN_MATCH_DENIED. Otherwise, return PATTERN_MATCH_ALLOWED unless the
 *         interface match is exact, in this case return PATTERN_MATCH_ALLOWED_EXACT.
