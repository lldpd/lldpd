Comment:
 It is believed that header files are an interface for user space and
 therefore cannot be covered by copyright.

Comment:
 APSL incompatibility with GPL is not a problem here:
   1. It is believed that header files are an interface for user space and
      therefore cannot be covered by copyright.
   2. Those headers are used only on OS X.
