lldpd (0.6)
  * Features:
    + Allow lldpctl to display hidden ports.
    + Add a switch to specify interfaces to use to get chassis ID.
  * Global changes:
    + Partial rewrite of the SNMP part. Less code.
    + Unit tests for SNMP.
    + Major rewrite of the protocol between lldpd and lldpctl. Less
      code.
  * Fixes:
    + Several small SNMP fixes (discovered by unit tests).

lldpd (0.5.6)
  * Features:
    + Send and receive native VLAN TLV with CDP
    + Add a whitelist for some drivers (currently: dsa and veth)
  * Fixes:
    + Compilation issues with NetSNMP 5.7 (and with earlier versions too)
    + Small optimization of BPF filter

lldpd (0.5.5)
  * Features:
    + Support for PPVID and PI Dot1 TLV, thanks to Shuah Khan.
    + Extend whitelist with possibility to blacklist.
  * Fixes:
    + Key/value output was incorrect when a dot was present in
      interface names. This is fixed but it is preferable to use XML
      output since the parsing is more difficult in this case.
    + Only grab DMI information once. Only uses DMI for x86 platform.
    + Padding issues with socket protocol. This introduces a change in
      the socket protocol!
    + Fix a segfault when neither /etc/os-release nor lsb_release
      are available.

lldpd (0.5.4)
  * Features:
    + Get OS information from /etc/os-release if available. Patch from
      Michael Tremer.
    + Add a flag to specify which interfaces lldpd should listen to.

lldpd (0.5.3)
  * Fixes:
    + Allow root to change configuration of lldpd when lldpctl has suid set.
  * Features:
    + Handle Dot3 POE-MDI TLV (802.3af and 802.3at).
    + Allow to set Dot3 POE-MDI from lldpctl.

lldpd (0.5.2)
  * Features:
    + More flexible smart mode and new default. Manual page has been updated.
    + Add a "receive-only" mode with "-r" switch.

lldpd (0.5.1)
  * Features:
    + Allow to force a protocol even when no peer for this protocol is
      detected.
    + Add a smart mode that allows to discard bogus port information,
      for example CDP packets that are flooded through a switch that
      does not support CDP.
    + Allow to set LLDP-MED network policy from lldpctl, thanks to a patch from
      Philipp Kempgen.
    + Allow to set LLDP-MED POE-MDI from lldpctl.
    + Add a summary of available options in "lldpd -h" and "lldpctl -h",
      thanks to a patch from Jorge Boncompte.
    + Add a new output (keyvalue) for lldpctl.
    + Listen on VLAN using an appropriate BPF filter, VLAN
      decapsulation. Older "listen on vlan" feature is discarded. See
      README for more information on the new feature.
    + Use output of lsb_release if available for system description.

  * Fixes:
    + Ignore interface with no queue. It should filter out interfaces
      like "vnet0" that would fail if we try to send something on them.
    + Don't check CDP checksums (not really a fix but it appears that
      Cisco checksum have some difficult corner cases).

lldpd (0.5.0)

  * Features:
    + lldpd can now handle several systems on the same port. This
      modification also allows to speak to a switch using CDP and LLDP
      for example.
    + The way that lldpd gathers information for each port has been
      abstracted. This should allow to support more systems (BSD for
      examples) or switch cores in the future. Sending/receive support
      is also abstracted.
    + Add "-k" switch to avoid to emit too much information on running
      kernel.
    + Support of ifAlias with kernel >= 2.6.28
    + Lot of portability stuff. lldpd can now be compiled on RHEL
      2.1. Still Linux-only though.
    + Add an option to specify AgentX socket (-X).
    + Add some unit tests
    + lldpctl has been reworked; it is now able to output data in XML
      format for easier parsing. Patches were provided by Andreas
      Hofmeister.

  * Bug fixes:
    + Fix EDP VLAN handling
    + Silent warnings about bridge stuff.
    + Copy /etc/localtime into chroot before starting lldpd daemon to
      ensure correct timestamps for logs.

lldpd (0.4.1)

  * Fix EDP handling when there is no VLAN
  * Fix CDP version to not always be 1
  * Misc fix:
     + incorrect number of arguments for a LLOG_INFO call
     + fix SNMP last change in case this change occurs before start time

lldpd (0.4)

  * Rewrite of packet builder and parser to be able to cope with
    architecture that cannot do unaligned read. For decoder, we don't
    cast structures any more since they can be unaligned. For encoder,
    we use memcpy through the use of macro that build packets step by
    step.

lldpd (0.3.2)

  * Fix LLDP-MED support

lldpd (0.3.1)

  * Misc fixes, including memory leaks

lldpd (0.3)

  * Initial support of LLDP-MED
  * Fix for bridge detection (don't send bridge ioctl on random interfaces)
  * For bonded devices, get the real hardware address. For inactive
    slaves, transmit using a random MAC address.

lldpd (0.2.1)

  * Fix a syntax error in manual page
  * Fix open() calls

lldpd (0.2)

  * Add privilege separation
  * Add FDP support
  * Support CDP encapsulated into native VLAN
  * Various fixes

lldpd (0.1)

  * Initial release
