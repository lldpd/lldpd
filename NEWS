      CVE-2020-27827.
  * Changes:
    + Enable "router" capability bit when IPv6 routing is enabled.

lldpd (1.0.7)
  * Fix:
    + Do not listen only to LLDP packets on Linux. When an interface
      is enslaved to an Open vSwitch, incoming packets are missed.

lldpd (1.0.6)
  * Fix:
    + Do not loose chassis local information when interface status changes.
    + Fix SNMP walk on lldpRemTable when missing remote system
      name or description.
    + Remove length limitation on system description and platform.

    + On Linux, only register protocol handler for LLDP when only LLDP
      is enabled.
    + Stricter on LLDP incoming frames validation.
    + Add support for VLAN-aware bridges for Linux (no range support).
    + Add support for 802.3BT (no SNMP support).

lldpd (1.0.3)
  * Fix:
    + Fix creation of chroot directory.

lldpd (1.0.2)
  * Changes:
    + On Linux, the monitor process will now drop its privileges
      instead of running as root. It will keep CAP_NET_RAW,
      CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE capabilities.
    + Support for CDP PD PoE (with negotiation). Thanks to Gustav
      Wiklander.
    + Move support for bonded devices on Linux < 2.6.27 into the
      `--enable-oldies` option. This avoids duplicate packets
      starting from Linux 4.19.

lldpd (1.0.1)
  * Fix:
    + Use "mkdir -p" instead of "mkdir" in systemd unit.

lldpd (1.0.0)
  * Changes:
    + Chassis ID can be set to an arbitrary value with "configure system
      chassisid".
    + Port description can be overriden directly with "configure lldp
      portdescription".
    + Command "configure system interface permanent" enables one to
      specify a pattern for interfaces to be kept in memory even when
      they are removed from the system.
  * Fix:
    + Ensure chassis-related changes are propagated immediately.
    + Ensure management address change is correctly detected.

lldpd (0.9.9)
  * Changes:
    + lldpcli can now display local interfaces with LLDP data sent on
      each of them ("show interfaces").
    + As Dot3 PD device, echo back allocated value from PSE device.
  * Fix:
    + Don't remove interfaces when they are released from a bridge.
    + Don't use "expect stop" with Upstart. It's buggy.

lldpd (0.9.8)
  * Changes:
    + "Station" capability is only set if no other bit is set.
    + Use ethtool to get permanent address for bonds and teams. This
      might provide different results than the previous method. Some
      devices may still use the previous method.
    + Don't run ethtool as root. Kernels older than 2.6.19 won't get
      link information anymore.
    + Add "configure system hostname ." option to not use a FQDN
      for system name.
    + Add "-f json0" to provide a more regular/machine-parsable output
      to JSON output, even when not compiled with --enable-json0.
  * Fixes:
    + Handle team interfaces like a bond. Real MAC address cannot be
      retrieved yet.

lldpd (0.9.7)
  * Changes:
    + Attach remote TTL to port instead of chassis.
    + JSON support is now built-in and unconditionally enabled. Use
      --enable-json0 to keep the pre-0.9.2 json-c format.
    + When logging to syslog and daemonizing, don't log to stderr.
    + vxlan interfaces are now ignored as they are multi-point interfaces.
    + Maximum number of neighbors for an interface is increased from 4 to 32.

lldpd (0.9.6)
  * Changes:
    + Add a compile-time option to restore pre-0.9.2 JSON format (when
      using json-c). Use `--enable-json0` to enable this option.
    + Support for newer ethtool interface on Linux
      (ETHTOOL_GLINKSETTINGS) and additional speed settings.
    + Current MAU type is displayed even when autoneg is off.
    + Increase netlink receive buffer by default. Can be changed at
      compile-time through ./configure.
  * Fixes:
    + Correctly parse LLDP-MED civic address when the length of the
      TLV exceeds the length of the address.
    + Fix 100% CPU on some rare error condition.
    + Fix lost timer when an interface is enslaved on Linux.

lldpd (0.9.5)
  * Changes:
    + More Ethernet media supported. However, RFC4836 is quite
      out-of-date with respected to 10G+ speeds, bringing some
      inaccuracies.
    + Directly get media information for an interface without using
      the privileged process.
    + LLDP-MED capability TLV is not sent when LLDP-MED is not enabled,
      even if other LLDP-MED TLV are present.
  * Fixes:
    + Compilation fix with older versions of GCC.
    + Don't use ethtool at all to get real MAC address for enslaved
      devices (always use /proc).

lldpd (0.9.4)
  * Changes:
    + Make lldpd accepts a `-p` option to specify the PID file.
    + Ability to change multicast MAC address to two additional values
      to reach customer bridges.
    + lldpcli will now display chassis TTL when detailed view is enabled.
  * Fixes:
    + Fix setting of local value for port ID.
    + Fix compilation with BSD make.
    + Ensure lldpcli returns an error code on invalid commands.

lldpd (0.9.3)
  * Changes:
    + Do not rely on support of constructors for liblldpctl.
    + Always log to stderr (even in addition to syslog).
    + `lldpcli watch` accepts a limit on the number of received events.
  * Fixes:
    + `lldpcli -f {xml,json} watch` should work now.
    + Consider `veth` interfaces as physical interfaces.

lldpd (0.9.2)
  * Changes:
    + Ability to add/remove/replace custom TLV from lldpcli.
    + LLDP-MED capabilities are displayed differently in lldpcli.
    + Limit the maximum depth (5) when trying to apply a VLAN.
    + Change JSON output format when using json-c to match Jansson
      output.
    + Integration tests for the major parts of lldpd, including use of
      address and leak sanitizer.
  * Fixes:
    + LLDP-MED POE TLV are now displayed in lldpcli.
    + Ignore lower link when it is in another namespace.
    + Fix various problems with interfaces being enslaved.
    + Fix a memory leak when modifying port-related settings.

lldpd (0.9.1)
  * Changes:
    + Rework packaging for OS X to make it work with El Capitan. To
      simplify a bit, it is not possible anymore to build fat
      binaries. Latest version of OS X supporting 32bit was 10.6.
  * Fixes:
    + By default, when using port alias as description, use port name
      as port ID.
    + Miscellaneous fixes with netlink cache.
    + Ensure large netlink messages can be received.

lldpd (0.9.0)
  * Changes:
    + Don't rely on libnl3 for netlink. Reuse the previous code and
      implement a lighweight cache.

lldpd (0.8.0, never released)
  * Changes:
    + PIE is now disabled by default. It's too difficult to reliably
      detect if it works. Use --enable-pie to enable it.
    + Retrieve the permanent MAC address of an interface through
      ethtool for Linux if /proc/net/bonding is not available.
    + Running lldpd with "-d" will keep the process in foreground but
      logs will still go to syslog. To log to the console, add at
      least one "-d".
    + Fix minimal kernel version to 2.6.39. Add a runtime warning when
      this is not the case.
    + Remove old bridge code (the one using ioctl).
    + Don't discard down interfaces. Notably, this enables us to keep
      their specific configuration if any.
    + For Linux, switch to libnl3. Be aware of the licensing issues in
      case of static linking.
    + Introduce the notion of default local port. New interfaces will
      use it as a base. This allows setting various MED stuff.
    + Provide an apparmor profile (untested).
  * Fixes:
    + Fix a buffer overflow when receiving a too large management
      address TLV. Unless hardening has been disabled, this overflow
      cannot be used for arbitrary code execution.
    + Update LLDP-MED policy L2 priority values to match
      802.1Q-2005. This may be a breaking change.

lldpd (0.7.17)
  * Fixes:
    + Fix the way libevent configure is called.
    + Fix an infinite loop when using veth on Linux 4.1+ kernels.
    + Make CDP advertise the appropriate kernel name as platform,
      not just "Linux".

lldpd (0.7.16)
  * Changes:
    + For Linux, 2.6.32 is now the minimal required kernel. When using
      an older kernel, use `--enable-oldies`.
    + For Linux, use netlink to retrieve information about bridges,
      VLAN and bonds. The code was contributed by Cumulus Networks.
    + Use symbol versioning for liblldpctl.so.
    + Ability to get local chassis information with "show
      chassis".
    + The library also has the same ability with the
      `lldpctl_get_local_chassis()` function. It is also possible to
      get a chassis atom from a port with `lldpctl_k_port_chassis`
      key. This is now the preferred way to retrieve chassis related
      information.
  * Fixes:
    + Fix build on OS X.
    + Accept "language" when configuring MED location as a civic address.

lldpd (0.7.15)
  * Changes:
    + Optional features can be configured with "auto" to autodetect if
      they are usable. This is the default value for JSON and XML support.
    + Ability to send and decode custom/unknown TLV. Thanks to Alexandru
      Ardelean.
    + Modify checksum function. While this should be strictly
      equivalent, if you notice CDP packets not accepted anymore, this
      change is the first culprit.

lldpd (0.7.14)
  * Changes:
    + Shutdown LLPDU are sent on MSAP change and when lldpd exits.
    + When an exact IP is provided as a management pattern, use it
      unconditionally.
    + Ability to set port ID and description to an arbitrary value,
      thanks to Alexandru Ardelean.
  * Fixes:
    + Incorrect boundary check when decoding management address and
      protocol identity may lead to lldpd crash when processing
      malformed LLDPDU.
    + Many edge cases where lldpd was leaving hanging processes after
      crashing.

lldpd (0.7.13)
  * Fixes:
    + Unbreak customization of Unix socket path from command line.

lldpd (0.7.12)
  * Changes:
    + Interface pattern, management pattern, system description,
      system platform and system hostname can be unconfigured to their
      default values.
  * Fixes:
    + Don't complain when parsing a commented line.
    + Correctly persist configuration changes for "system interface
      promiscuous", "system interface description" "med fast-start
      enable", "pause" and "resume".
    + Fix listening on bond devices for old kernels (< 2.6.27).

lldpd (0.7.11)
  * Changes:
    + Ship bash and zsh completion.
    + Abort when some command-line options are repeated.
  * Fixes:
    + Handle correctly read failures in liblldpctl.

lldpd (0.7.10)
  * Changes:
    + Ability to set promiscuous mode to work around bugs of some
      switches encapsulating LLDP frames inside 802.1Q frames.
    + JSON support for lldpcli can use json-c instead of jansson,
      thanks to Michel Stam.
  * Fixes:
    + Fix checksum computation for Cisco CDP.
    + Fix ability to disable LLDP.
    + Fix seccomp sandbox, thanks to Patrick McLean.

lldpd (0.7.9)
  * Changes:
    + Default location for chroot, socket and PID are now configurable
      in `./configure`. The default location is based on the value of
      `runstatedir` which in turn may be based on the value of
      `localstatedir` which defaults to `/usr/local/var`. Therefore,
      to get the previous locations, lldpd should be configured with
      `./configure --localstatedir=/var`.
    + Add support for shutdown LLDPU.
    + Ability to configure IP management pattern from lldpcli.
    + Ability to choose what port ID should be (MAC or interface name).
  * Fixes:
    + Fix `configure system bond-slave-src-mac-type local`. Also use
      it as default.

lldpd (0.7.8)
  * Changes:
    + Android support
    + Add the possibility to disable privilege separation (lower
      memory consumption, lower security, don't do it).
    + Interfaces can now be whitelisted. For example, *,!eth*,!!eth1
      is a valid pattern for all interfaces except eth ones, except
      eth1. Moreover, on exact match, an matching interface
      circumvents most sanity checks (like VLAN handling).
    + Ability to override the hostname.
  * Fixes:
    + Don't hard-code default values for system name, system
      description and port description. When the field is not present,
      just don't display it.
    + Fix lldpcli behaviour when suid.
    + On OSX, don't use p2p0 interfaces: it would break WLAN.
    + Fix SNMP support on RHEL.

lldpd (0.7.7)
  * Changes:
    + Use a locally administered MAC address or an arbitrary one
      instead of null MAC address for bond devices on Linux. This is
      configurable through `lldpcli`.
    + Add support for "team" driver (alternative to bond devices).
    + Preliminary support for DTrace/systemtap.
    + Preliminary support for seccomp (for monitor process).
    + Setup chroot inside lldpd instead of relying on init script.
  * Fixes:
    + Various bugs related to fixed point number handling (for
      coordinates in LLDP-MED)
    + Fix a regression in how MAC address of an enslaved device is
      retrieved.

lldpd (0.7.6)
  * Changes:
    + Provide a way to build packages for OSX.
    + Add an option to update interface description with neighbor name.
  * Fixes:
    + Compilation fix for OSX 10.6.

lldpd (0.7.5)
  * Fixes:
    + Segfault while tokenizing in lldpcli.

lldpd (0.7.4)
  * Fixes:
    + Segfault in lldpcli.
    + Memory leak in liblldpctl when using a custom log handler.
    + Fix some unaligned memory accesses.
    + Fix frame reception on OpenBSD.
  * Changes:
    + Allow to configure hold value from lldpcli (and hence the TTL).
    + Allow to configure pattern for valid interfaces from lldpcli.
    + Allow to override system description from lldpcli.
    + Display the neighbor connected as the process title (or the
      number of connected neighbors).

lldpd (0.7.3)
  * Changes:
    + DragonFly BSD support.
    + Solaris support (incomplete).
    + LLDP-MED fast start support (thanks to Roopa Prabhu).
    + Provide global statistics through "show statistics summary"
      command (thanks to Roopa Prabhu).
  * Fixes:
    + Fix IPv4/IPv6 address discovery in Linux.

lldpd (0.7.2)
  * Changes:
    + lldpd can be configured through /etc/lldpd.conf and
      /etc/lldpd.d. All commands accepted by lldpcli are accepted.
    + Lock BPF interfaces before handing them to chrooted process on
      BSD.
    + Limit the number of neighbors for each port to 4 (per protocol).
    + Force CDPv2 protocol with argument `-ccc`.
    + Provide port statistics through "show statistics" command
      (thanks to Roopa Prabhu).
  * Fixes:
    + Driver whitelisting is done before checking if an interface has
      a lower interface in Linux.
    + Expire remote ports and chassis in a timely manner.

lldpd (0.7.1)
  * Changes:
    + Mac OS X support, sponsored by Xcloud, Mac cloud server hosting
      provider. http://xcloud.me/
    + Upstart and systemd support.
    + Remove Unix socket when there is no process listening.

lldpd (0.7.0)
  * Changes:
    + FreeBSD support.
    + OpenBSD support.
    + NetBSD support.
    + Detect interface changes.
    + CLI for lldpctl: lldpcli.
    + Allow to disable LLDP protocol (with `-ll`). In this case, the
      first enabled protocol will be used when no neighbor is detected.
    + Allow to filter debug logs using tokens. Add more debug logs.
    + lldpctl can now output JSON.
    + Use netlink to gather interface information on Linux.
    + Don't use ioctl for bridges anymore on Linux. The configure
      option `--enable-oldies` allow to reenable their uses for
      systems not supporting sysfs.

lldpd (0.6.1)
  * Changes:
    + Provide liblldpctl.so, a library to interface with lldpd. The
      documentation is provided through Doxygen. See src/lib/lldpctl.h
      which contains all the exported functions.
    + Make lldpctl uses liblldpctl.so.
    + Add a "watch" option to lldpctl to monitor neighbor changes.
    + Add the possibility to display the current configuration of
      lldpd with lldpctl. Also add the possibility to reset the
      current transmit delay.

lldpd (0.6)
  * Changes:
    + Allow lldpctl to display hidden ports.
    + Add a switch to specify interfaces to use to get chassis ID.
    + Support for multiple management addresses and IPv6 management
      addresses. Contributed by João Valverde.
    + Switch to libevent. See README.md for details.
    + Partial rewrite of the SNMP part. Less code.
    + Unit tests for SNMP.
    + Major rewrite of the protocol between lldpd and lldpctl. Less
      code.
  * Fixes:
    + Several small SNMP fixes (discovered by unit tests).

lldpd (0.5.7)
 * Fixes:
    + Configure issue with NetSNMP and some linkers
    + Fix infinite loop for the receive part: on certain conditions,
      lldpd will stop sending packets and stop updating local data.

lldpd (0.5.6)
  * Changes:
    + Send and receive native VLAN TLV with CDP
    + Add a whitelist for some drivers (currently: dsa and veth)
  * Fixes:
    + Compilation issues with NetSNMP 5.7 (and with earlier versions too)
    + Small optimization of BPF filter

lldpd (0.5.5)
  * Changes:
    + Support for PPVID and PI Dot1 TLV, thanks to Shuah Khan.
    + Extend whitelist with possibility to blacklist.
  * Fixes:
    + Key/value output was incorrect when a dot was present in
      interface names. This is fixed but it is preferable to use XML
      output since the parsing is more difficult in this case.
    + Only grab DMI information once. Only uses DMI for x86 platform.
    + Padding issues with socket protocol. This introduces a change in
      the socket protocol!
    + Fix a segfault when neither /etc/os-release nor lsb_release
      are available.

lldpd (0.5.4)
  * Changes:
    + Get OS information from /etc/os-release if available. Patch from
      Michael Tremer.
    + Add a flag to specify which interfaces lldpd should listen to.

lldpd (0.5.3)
  * Changes:
    + Handle Dot3 POE-MDI TLV (802.3af and 802.3at).
    + Allow to set Dot3 POE-MDI from lldpctl.
  * Fixes:
    + Allow root to change configuration of lldpd when lldpctl has suid set.

lldpd (0.5.2)
  * Changes:
    + More flexible smart mode and new default. Manual page has been updated.
    + Add a "receive-only" mode with "-r" switch.

lldpd (0.5.1)
  * Changes:
    + Allow to force a protocol even when no peer for this protocol is
      detected.
    + Add a smart mode that allows to discard bogus port information,
      for example CDP packets that are flooded through a switch that
      does not support CDP.
    + Allow to set LLDP-MED network policy from lldpctl, thanks to a patch from
      Philipp Kempgen.
    + Allow to set LLDP-MED POE-MDI from lldpctl.
    + Add a summary of available options in "lldpd -h" and "lldpctl -h",
      thanks to a patch from Jorge Boncompte.
    + Add a new output (keyvalue) for lldpctl.
    + Listen on VLAN using an appropriate BPF filter, VLAN
      decapsulation. Older "listen on vlan" feature is discarded. See
      README for more information on the new feature.
    + Use output of lsb_release if available for system description.
  * Fixes:
    + Ignore interface with no queue. It should filter out interfaces
      like "vnet0" that would fail if we try to send something on them.
    + Don't check CDP checksums (not really a fix but it appears that
      Cisco checksum have some difficult corner cases).

lldpd (0.5.0)
  * Changes:
    + lldpd can now handle several systems on the same port. This
      modification also allows to speak to a switch using CDP and LLDP
      for example.
    + The way that lldpd gathers information for each port has been
      abstracted. This should allow to support more systems (BSD for
      examples) or switch cores in the future. Sending/receive support
      is also abstracted.
    + Add "-k" switch to avoid to emit too much information on running
      kernel.
    + Support of ifAlias with kernel >= 2.6.28
    + Lot of portability stuff. lldpd can now be compiled on RHEL
      2.1. Still Linux-only though.
    + Add an option to specify AgentX socket (-X).
    + Add some unit tests
    + lldpctl has been reworked; it is now able to output data in XML
      format for easier parsing. Patches were provided by Andreas
      Hofmeister.
  * Fixes:
    + Fix EDP VLAN handling
    + Silent warnings about bridge stuff.
    + Copy /etc/localtime into chroot before starting lldpd daemon to
      ensure correct timestamps for logs.

lldpd (0.4.1)
  * Fix EDP handling when there is no VLAN
  * Fix CDP version to not always be 1
  * Misc fix:
     + incorrect number of arguments for a LLOG_INFO call
     + fix SNMP last change in case this change occurs before start time

lldpd (0.4)
  * Rewrite of packet builder and parser to be able to cope with
    architecture that cannot do unaligned read. For decoder, we don't
    cast structures any more since they can be unaligned. For encoder,
    we use memcpy through the use of macro that build packets step by
    step.

lldpd (0.3.2)
  * Fix LLDP-MED support

lldpd (0.3.1)
  * Misc fixes, including memory leaks

lldpd (0.3)
  * Initial support of LLDP-MED
  * Fix for bridge detection (don't send bridge ioctl on random interfaces)
  * For bonded devices, get the real hardware address. For inactive
    slaves, transmit using a random MAC address.

lldpd (0.2.1)
  * Fix a syntax error in manual page
  * Fix open() calls

lldpd (0.2)
  * Add privilege separation
  * Add FDP support
  * Support CDP encapsulated into native VLAN
  * Various fixes

lldpd (0.1)
  * Initial release
