`lldpd` contains several security features to mitigate vulnerabilities
(privilege separation, chrooted process, …). If you wish to report a
security issue, either open an [issue on GitHub][] or [mail me][]
directly.

# Past vulnerabilities

 * [CVE-2015-8011][]: buffer overflow when handling management address
   TLV for LLDP. When a remote device was advertising a too large
   management address while still respecting TLV boundaries, lldpd
   would crash due to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability affects
   the parser which is run in an unprivileged and chrooted
   process. It does not allow arbitrary code execution
   unless hardening has been specifically disabled. This bug has been
   introduced in version 0.6.0. It has been fixed in commit
   [dd4f16e7][] and in version 0.7.19.

 * [CVE-2015-8012][]: crash on malformed management address. When a
   remote device was advertising a malformed management address, lldpd
   would crash with an assertion error. This vulnerability affects the
   parser which is run in an unprivileged and chrooted process. It
   does not allow arbitrary code execution. This bug has been
   introduced in version 0.6.0. It has been fixed in commit
   [793526f8][] and in version 0.7.19.
