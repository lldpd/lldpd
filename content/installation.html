`lldpd` supports several OS. You can install it from packages or from
sources. Once installed, you may want to look
[how to use and configure it]([[usage.html]]).

[TOC]

# GNU/Linux

## Debian and Ubuntu

`lldpd` is already available in Debian and Ubuntu. You can install it
with:

    ::console
    $ sudo apt-get install lldpd
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    The following extra packages will be installed:
    [...]

It will be installed and configured to start at boot. You can change
the options of `lldpd` in `/etc/default/lldpd`.

If the package is not recent enough, you can use the
[Debian backports][] on Debian. Follow the instructions available on
the website.

If it is still not recent enough, you can grab the appropriate Debian
package from [openSUSE Build Service][]. Follow the instructions
available on the website.

The last option is to to [build _lldpd_ from source][]. You can still
install and uninstall the package to get `_lldpd` user and group, as
well as a working init script.

## Gentoo

`lldpd` is available in portage. Just issue the command `emerge lldpd`
to install it. You can also [build _lldpd_ from source][].

## Fedora, RHEL, CentOS

`lldpd` is available in the main Fedora and RHEL 8 repositories.
Just issue the command `dnf install lldpd` to install it.

For older distro versions, like RHEL 7, it is available from the
[EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repository. In this case,
you need to install the `epel-release` package before issuing the
`yum install lldpd` command.

Once the `lldpd` package is installed, you can change its options via
the `/etc/sysconfig/lldpd` file.

Alternatively, you can install the packages
from [openSUSE Build Service][]. Follow the instructions available on
the website.

It is also possible to [build _lldpd_ from source][].

## SUSE

On SLES 12, openSUSE Leap 42.3 or openSUSE Tumbleweed, `lldpd` is
available directly with the following command:

    ::console
    $ sudo zypper install lldpd
    The following 11 NEW packages are going to be installed:
      libbsd0 libdb-4_8 libevent-2_0-5 libgdbm4 liblldpctl4 libsensors4 libsnmp30 libwrap0 lldpd perl snmp-mibs
    
    11 new packages to install.
    Overall download size: 8.7 MiB. Already cached: 0 B. After the operation, additional 47.8 MiB will be used.
    Continue? [y/n/...? shows all options] (y): y
    [...]
    (11/11) Installing: lldpd-0.9.9-2.1.x86_64 ...............[done]

It is also possible to [build _lldpd_ from source][].

## Docker

You can use Docker to run `lldpd`:

    docker run --rm --net=host --uts=host \
               -v /etc/os-release:/etc/os-release \
               --cap-add=NET_RAW --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
               --name lldpd \
               ghcr.io/lldpd/lldpd:latest

In place of `latest` which provides you with the latest stable
version, you may use `1`, `1.0`, `{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}`
to match specific versions.

To execute `lldpcli`, use:

    docker exec lldpd lldpcli show neighbors

Or to get the command-line:

    docker exec -it lldpd lldpcli

# BSD

`lldpd` is currently available in the ports tree of most BSDs[^ports].
Follow the instructions on how to install lldpd from ports by following
the documentation specific to the respective ports tree.

Some BSDs provide up-to-date binary packages using their respective
package management tools.

Though if you want to [build _lldpd_ from source][]. You can add
`_lldpd` user with `vipw` and add `_lldpd` group by adding it manually
in `/etc/group`. The user must not be able to login, have its home as
`/var/empty` and a disabled shell (like `/bin/false`).

[^ports]: It has been added to the ports tree of OpenBSD (net/lldpd),
          FreeBSD (net-mgmt/lldpd) and NetBSD's pkgsrc (net/lldpd).
          DragonFly uses the FreeBSD port with an overlay named DeltaPorts.

You may want to configure `lldpd` with
`--with-privsep-chroot=/var/empty` to avoid to create
`/var/run/lldpd`.

If `lldpcli` is not able to provide completion, you can use the `help`
command instead or install the GNU Readline library on your system.

# macOS

The easiest way is to use the
[installer package for macOS][lastpkg]. You need at least macOSÂ 10.6.

Alternatively, you can use [Homebrew][]. Check the website if you
don't have it, it is easy to install. Once installed, type in a
terminal:

    ::console
    $ brew install https://raw.github.com/lldpd/lldpd/master/osx/lldpd.rb
    ######################################################################## 100.0%
    ==> Downloading https://media.luffy.cx/files/lldpd/lldpd-{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}.tar.gz
    ==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/lldpd/{{ resource.meta.latestversion }} --with-xml --with-readline
    [...]

Pay attention at the instructions at the end of the build: they
explain how to create `_lldpd` user and group and how to run `lldpd`
when the system starts.

At least, you can [build _lldpd_ from source][].

# Install from source

This is the last resort method. Other methods are usually simpler.

You first need to download the latest version
([{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}][lasttgz]) (do not download it
from GitHub, you would get an incomplete archive). You need a working
build environment.

    ::console
    $ tar zxvf lldpd-{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}.tar.gz
    $ cd lldpd-{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
    checking whether build environment is sane... yes
    checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /bin/mkdir -p
    checking for gawk... gawk
    [...]
    ------------------ Summary ------------------
     lldpd version {{ meta.resource.latestversion }}

      C Compiler.....: gcc -g -O2 -fdiagnostics-show-option -std=gnu99 -pipe -Wall -W -Wextra -Wformat -Wformat-security -Wcast-align -Winline -fstack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-sign-compare

      FDP............: yes
      EDP............: yes
      SONMP..........: yes
      LLDPMED........: yes
      DOT1...........: yes
      DOT3...........: yes
      XML output.....: no
    ---------------------------------------------

    Check the above options and compile with:
     make

If this steps fail, feel free to [file a bug report][]. The content
of `config.log` should be helpful. Otherwise, check if everything is
as you expect and continue.

    ::console
    $ make
      CC     strlcpy.lo
      CCLD   libcompat.la
      CC     log.lo
    [...]
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/bernat/src/lldpd-{{ resource.meta.latestversion }}'

If this steps fail, feel free to [file a bug report][] too with the
output and some details on your platform. The `config.log` is also
useful in this case.

You can finish the installation with `make install`. Then, you still
have to complete the following steps by yourself. They are system
specifics:

 - Ensure the `liblldpctl` library is correctly registered with the
   system. The output of `make install` should give the appropriate
   steps. On Linux, this is `ldconfig`.
 - Create a `_lldpd` user and a `_lldpd` group. This is needed for
   privilege seperation (increased security).
 - Create the chroot (`/usr/local/var/run/lldpd` by default). It is just an
   empty directory.
 - Ensure that `lldpd` is started at boot.

`../configure` accepts several options. You can get them with
`../configure --help`. The most interesting ones are `--with-snmp` and
`--with-xml`.
