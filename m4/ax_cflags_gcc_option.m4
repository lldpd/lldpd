# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION (optionflag [,[shellvar][,[A][,[NA]]])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION(-fvomit-frame) would show a message as like
#   "checking CFLAGS for gcc -fvomit-frame ... yes" and adds the optionflag
#   to CFLAGS if it is understood. You can override the shellvar-default of
#   CFLAGS of course. The order of arguments stems from the explicit macros
#   like AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL.
#
#   The cousin AX_CXXFLAGS_GCC_OPTION would check for an option to add to
#   CXXFLAGS - and it uses the autoconf setup for C++ instead of C (since it
#   is possible to use different compilers for C and C++).
#
#   The macro is a lot simpler than any special AX_CFLAGS_* macro (or
#   ac_cxx_rtti.m4 macro) but allows to check for arbitrary options.
#   However, if you use this macro in a few places, it would be great if you
#   would make up a new function-macro and submit it to the ac-archive.
#
#     - $1 option-to-check-for : required ("-option" as non-value)
#     - $2 shell-variable-to-add-to : CFLAGS (or CXXFLAGS in the other case)
#     - $3 action-if-found : add value to shellvariable
#     - $4 action-if-not-found : nothing
#
#   There are other variants that emerged from the original macro variant
#   which did just test an option to be possibly added. However, some
#   compilers accept an option silently, or possibly for just another option
#   that was not intended. Therefore, we have to do a generic test for a
#   compiler family. For gcc we check "-pedantic" being accepted which is
#   also understood by compilers who just want to be compatible with gcc
#   even when not being made from gcc sources.
#
#   This version has been modified by Vincent Bernat <bernat@luffy.cx>
#   to ensure that the shell variable the option is added to is
#   prepended to the test variable (like a regular CFLAGS).
#
#   See also: AX_CFLAGS_SUN_OPTION, AX_CFLAGS_HPUX_OPTION,
#   AX_CFLAGS_AIX_OPTION, and AX_CFLAGS_IRIX_OPTION.
